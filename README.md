This repository consists of my personal practise projects on Data Science and Machine Learning.

<b>1. Breast Cancer Detection</b> 

Predicting whether the cancer is benign or malignant

Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

Models used:  Logistic Regression , Random Forest 
 
An accuracy of 98.24 % was achieved in our final model, Linear Regression after hyperparameter tuning using Randomised Search and Cross Validation.

Final Output: The cancer is malignant


<b>2. Credit Card Fraud Detection</b> 

Anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine

Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?select=creditcard.csv

Models used:  Logistic Regression , Random Forest, XgBoost Classifer
 
An accuracy of 99.94 % was achieved in our final model, Random Forest

Final Output: The above dataset is not a fraudulent transaction



<b>3. Customer Segmentation </b> 

This case requires to develop a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy. The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.

Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata?select=CC+GENERAL.csv

Models used: K-Means

Elbow method was used to find optimal number of clusters




<b>4. E-Sign of load based on financial history </b> 

Electronic signatures aren’t exactly a novelty. They have been around since the American Civil War, during which contracts were signed through Morse. In a modern setting, an e-Sign refers to a unique, digitised, encrypted personal identifier. This is, in essence, different from the ‘wet’ signatures created by hand. The e-Sign is meant to complete transactions, loops, and agreements electronically.

Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata?select=CC+GENERAL.csv

Models used: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost Classifier 

An accuracy of 64% was achieved in our final model (XGBoost Classifer) after hyperparameter tuning using Randomised Search 

Final Output: The  customer with this dataset will not e-sign 



<b>5. Medical insurance premium prediction</b>

Predicting the insurance cost

Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance?select=insurance.csv

Models used: Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Xgboost Regression
 
An accuracy of 89.41% was achieved in our final model, Xgboost Regression
